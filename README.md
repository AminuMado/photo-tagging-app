<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>This was an introduction to the backend using firebase project for <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/where-s-waldo-a-photo-tagging-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Odin Project's</a> JavaScript curriculum. The goal of the project is to create a 'Wheres Waldo' type of game that incorporates a backend. Players select a level and must find 3 hidden characters. The characters coordinates are used to identify their location in the level, selecting the correct coordinates (along with the character) will mark a character as found. Firebase is used as a backend to store the game data & highscores for each level. This project as made with the React JS Library, TailwindCSS, and Firebase.</p>
